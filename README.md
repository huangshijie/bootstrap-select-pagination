bootstrap-select-pagination
================

Based on <a href="https://github.com/silviomoreto/bootstrap-select">bootstrap-select</a>, version 1.12.2.

Modify source code, with the premise that keep the original function I do very little work to make it support pagination.

And it's very simple for now, I will enhance its function in the further.

If you like it or it can help you, please give me star. 

JUST FOR FUN. AND GIVE U A THOUGHT TO DO PAGINATION IN BOOTSTRAP-SELECT.
